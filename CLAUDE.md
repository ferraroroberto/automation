# Project Instructions

Canonical instructions for AI coding agents working in this repository. Claude Code reads this file directly as project memory. Other agents (Cursor, Codex, etc.) reach it via the one-line `AGENTS.md` pointer.

## Plan mode is the default
Every non-trivial request starts in plan mode. Non-trivial = anything beyond a one-line fix, a typo, or a question I can answer without touching code.

In plan mode:
- Do NOT edit files, run destructive commands, or commit anything
- Investigate the codebase as needed (read files, search, run read-only commands)
- Resolve ambiguity through questions before proposing a plan
- Present the plan only when you're confident it reflects what I actually want
- Stay in plan mode across rejections — if I push back, revise and re-present, don't bail out to execution

Recommended setting in `.claude/settings.json`:
```json
{ "permissions": { "defaultMode": "plan" } }
```

Exit plan mode only after I explicitly approve. Approval transitions straight to execution in the same turn.

## Asking questions
Ask whenever a decision would be expensive to undo or genuinely ambiguous. One sharp question beats three filler ones. Use multi-choice (2-4 options) when the choice space is bounded — much faster for me to answer than prose.

**Always ask before assuming** any of these:
- File or module location for new code
- Data shape or schema
- Page placement (new page vs. section in existing page)
- `st.session_state` key names and scope (Streamlit projects)
- Caching strategy (`@st.cache_data` TTL vs. `@st.cache_resource`) (Streamlit projects)
- Widget `key=` names and input sources (Streamlit projects)
- Data source (upload, local file, DB via secrets)
- Error and empty-state handling
- Whether to add tests, and at what level

**Don't ask about** things you can determine by reading the code, things I've already specified, or process meta-questions like "is the plan ready?" — that's what plan approval is for.

If multiple reasonable approaches exist, present them as options with tradeoffs. Don't pick silently.

## Before editing
- Re-read any file before modifying it. Don't trust memory across long sessions.
- For files >500 LOC, read in chunks; don't assume you've seen the whole file.
- When renaming a symbol, search separately for: direct calls, type references, string literals, dynamic imports, re-exports, and tests.

## General conventions
- **Project layout** is documented in this repo's `README.md`. Don't assume `/app/`, `/src/`, `launch_app.bat`, or any specific paths exist — read the README first.
- **Config & secrets:** project config in `config.json` or similar; secrets always in `.env`, never committed. The canonical name for the env file is `.env` (not `venv` or anything else — `.venv` is the venv directory).
- **Logging:** use the language's logging facility. In Python that's `logging`, not `print()`. Emojis are welcome in log messages: ℹ️ ⚠️ ❌ ✅
- **Naming:** snake_case for files/functions (Python), PascalCase for classes, UPPER_CASE for constants.
- **Imports:** stdlib → third-party → local.
- **Versioning policy:** follow the existing style in `requirements.txt` / `package.json` — keep `==` where the file uses pins, keep `>=` where it uses lower bounds. Don't change the policy unless explicitly asked.
- **Virtual environment:** use the existing `.venv`. Never create `venv`. Never activate — invoke via `& .\.venv\Scripts\python.exe ...` on Windows, `./.venv/bin/python ...` on POSIX.
- **No hardcoded paths or credentials.**
- **Type hints** on all public Python functions. Use `Optional[T]`, never bare `None` returns.
- Implement only what was asked. No nice-to-haves.

## Streamlit conventions
*Apply only if this project uses Streamlit.*

- `st.set_page_config(layout="wide", page_title="...")` MUST be the first Streamlit call.
- Use `width="stretch"` (and `width="content"` where appropriate) in new and modified code. **Never** introduce new `use_container_width=True` — it is deprecated. When you touch existing code that uses `use_container_width`, migrate it.
- All mutable state in `st.session_state`. No module-level globals.
- `@st.cache_data` for DataFrames/files; `@st.cache_resource` for DB clients/models.
- Every widget needs a stable, explicit `key=`.
- UI code only in the UI directory (e.g. `app/`). Data logic stays in the non-UI package (e.g. `src/`). Never import `streamlit` from non-UI code.
- User feedback via `st.error()` / `st.warning()` / `st.success()`, not `st.write()`.

## Phased execution for larger work
Multi-file refactors don't go in a single response. Break into phases of ≤5 files each. Complete phase 1, run verification, wait for my approval, then phase 2. Same rule for any task you'd estimate at >30 minutes of work.

## Verification (before declaring a task done)
Examples — adapt to the project's actual tooling:

Windows / PowerShell:
- Syntax: `& .\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m py_compile <file>`
- Lint (if configured): `ruff check .`
- Tests (if any exist): `& .\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest`
- Streamlit boot check (UI changes): `& .\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m streamlit run app/app.py --server.headless true`

POSIX:
- Syntax: `./.venv/bin/python -m py_compile <file>`
- Tests: `./.venv/bin/python -m pytest`

If no checker exists for a project, say so explicitly. Don't claim "tests pass" when there are no tests.

## Documentation discipline
For feature work and refactors (not trivial fixes):
- Update `README.md` if usage, config, or output changed
- If the project already has a `docs/` folder, add `docs/YYYY-MM-DD-short-description.md` with: what was done, files modified, validation run
- Don't create a `docs/` folder just to file a changelog entry on a one-off task

For one-line fixes and typos: skip the changelog.

## Git
Never auto-commit or push. Never stage files without being asked. When a task is done, ask: "Shall I prepare the commit message?" When asked, provide a ready-to-copy block:

```bash
git add <files>
git commit -m "type: short description

- detail 1
- detail 2"
```

I run it in my own terminal.

## Senior-dev check
Before finishing, ask: "What would a senior, perfectionist dev reject in review?" If the answer points at duplicated state, inconsistent patterns, or broken architecture *within the file you're already editing*, fix it. Don't expand scope to unrelated files.
